   - üîÑ Unified vision-language model
   - üîÑ Potentially better multimodal integration
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Larger model, resource intensive
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Less documentation available

2. **LLaMA-2/Gemma (Excluded from initial implementation)**
   - ‚ùå Requires special access/permissions
   - ‚ùå Large resource requirements
   - ‚ùå May not be accessible for thesis timeline
